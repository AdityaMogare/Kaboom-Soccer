# ⚽ Kaboom Soccer  

**An air-hockey style soccer game with a strategic twist – hidden mines add chaos, surprise, and mind games.**  

---

## 🎮 Logline  
Kaboom Soccer is a fast-paced arcade sports game that combines the reflex-driven gameplay of air-hockey with the strategic unpredictability of hidden mines. Before the match begins, each player secretly plants two invisible mines, turning every play into a mix of **skill, survival, and strategy**.

## 📚 Genre Research  

Kaboom Soccer draws inspiration from:  
- **Rocket League** – physics-based sports action with goal scoring.  
- **Windjammers** – disc-throwing, arena-style competition.  
- **Bomberman** – tactical hazards and explosive gameplay twists.

## 🌀 Tropes  

Arcade sports and arena games often include:  
- **Goal-based objectives** → Score more points than the opponent within a time limit.  
- **Short, replayable matches** → High-energy, skill-based loops.  
- **Physics-driven objects** → Dynamic and unpredictable gameplay.  
- **Multiplayer head-to-head** → Emphasis on reflexes and positioning.  
- **Power-ups / hazards** → Chaos and variety mid-match.  

Kaboom Soccer builds on these tropes with its own **innovation: hidden mines**.

## 💥 The Twist: Hidden Mines  

- Before the match, each player plants **two invisible mines** on their half of the field.  
- Mines are hidden and **eliminate opposing disks** on collision.  
- Unlike temporary power-ups, mine effects are **permanent**, shrinking a team’s options.  
- Adds **pre-match strategy**, **mid-match surprise**, and **long-term consequences**.  
- Encourages **bluffing, baiting, and risk-reward decisions** alongside traditional reflex play.

## 🕹️ Prototype Description  

- Each player controls **3 disks**.  
- Goal: Hit the puck into the opponent’s goal.  
- Mines: Eliminate opponent disks on collision.  
- Matches are **fast-paced, time-limited**, and victory goes to the player with the higher score when the timer ends.  

---

## 📜 Gameplay Rules  

- Each player starts with **3 controllable disks**.  
- At the start, both players place **2 invisible mines** on their half.  
- Mines destroy **opponent disks** (not your own).  
- Disks can **pass, defend, and shoot** the puck.  
- Round ends when **timer = 0** → Higher score wins.

## 🎮 Controls  

**Blue Player**  
- Move Active Disk → `W A S D`  
- Switch Active Disk → `Q`  

**Red Player**  
- Move Active Disk → Arrow Keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`)  
- Switch Active Disk → `Right Ctrl`

## ⚙️ Mechanic Matrix  

| Twist / Mechanic       | How it Works | Player Impact | Why It’s Interesting |
|-------------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Hidden Trap Placement  | Before play begins, each player secretly places two invisible mines on their half of the field. | Players must adapt strategies when teammates are eliminated and navigate around hidden traps. | Adds **tension**, **unpredictability**, and **psychological mind games** to the traditional arcade soccer setup. |
